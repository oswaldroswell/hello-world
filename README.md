# hello-world
a test repository for nothing really.

I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing. I have no idea how this works. I need to run through this fifty times before I will be able to make any sense of it. If I am to understand this all correctly, then I think anyone can come in here and look at my stupid programs or whatever I put in here and do whatever the hell they want to to it, and then I can commit those changes to the "master branch," or not. And they can have a "fork," or something. I don't know. I just want a place to save little tiny programs that I write. Ridiculously tiny little programs.
